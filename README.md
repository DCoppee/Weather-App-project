# Weather App - What's the Weather

This solo project was realized during my Web Dev training @BeCode. It is part of learning how to handle APIs.

## Mission

The aim was to build a web page that displays the weather for the next five days, and allows the user to compare the weather of several cities simultaneously. The API used is Openweatherapp.

## Skills

- HTTP flow: send asynchronous requests to a remote server and process the results
- DOM manipulation: changing the DOM based on the results of the HTTP requests
- Learn to aggregate and parse data fetched from an API
- Responsiveness
- Nice visual

## Status

- The page is deployed via GitHub Pages.
- The main branch proposes a refactoring test of the Javascript functions and the SCSS.
